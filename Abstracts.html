                    On my master's thesis(still in progress), I go through different path planning methods used
                    for mobile robots. Starting from global path planning methods, I gradually reach local planning
                    since my application for my thesis is for indoor robots having contact with humans, making the
                    environment so dynamic and unpredictable. After inspecting different methods, I concentrate on
                    reinforcement learning and, more specifically, deep reinforcement learning since these mobile robots
                    are supposed to work among humans and need to react very quickly and safely. In the end, the algorithm
                    is to be created and implemented on Trutlebot via ROS and analyze the robot's performance in the environment.

                        A Novel Intelligent Parallel Parking System Based on Fuzzy Logic Without Using Sensor
                    </cite><br><br>
                    The applications of intelligent systems have received a growing interest in the automobile industry.
                    The car parking issue is one of the challenges for drivers, which can be solved by these smart systems.
                    In this study, a new method for automatic parallel parking problems is proposed.
                    The suggested method uses fuzzy inference to control, steer, and park the car in a tight space.
                    Two parallel embedded fuzzy controllers have been designed to navigate the vehicle on the desired path.
                    Unlike other studies that have used the error between developed and reference routes,
                    the proposed method only uses the car’s position data, similar to an experienced driver.
                    There is no need to use the sensors to track the desired path in this method, but the car’s kinematic model’s
                    output is the controllers' input.
                    Based on the obtained results, the generated path by controllers is close to the desired track.<br><br><br>

                        Easy-GT: Open-Source Software to Facilitate Making the Ground Truth for White Blood Cells Nucleus
                    </cite><br><br>
                    The nucleus of white blood cells (WBCs) plays a significant role in their detection and classification.
                    Appropriate feature extraction of the nucleus is necessary to fit a suitable artificial intelligence model to classify WBCs.
                    Therefore, designing a method is needed to segment the nucleus accurately.
                    The detected nuclei should be compared with the ground truths identified by a hematologist to obtain
                    a proper performance evaluation of the nucleus segmentation method. It is a time-consuming and tedious
                    task for experts to establish the ground truth manually. This paper presents an intelligent open-source
                    software called Easy-GT to create the ground truth of WBCs nucleus faster and easier. This software first
                    detects the nucleus by employing a new otsu's thresholding based method with a dice similarity coefficient
                    (DSC) of 95.42 %; the hematologist can then create a more accurate ground truth,
                    using the designed buttons to modify the threshold value. This software can speed
                    up ground truths forming process more than six times.<br><br><br>

                    Bearing faults is one of the essential issues that may cause a big catastrophe in factories.
                    It is imperative to detect bearing faults before they cause these catastrophes. To do so,
                    bearing signals need to be collected and studied carefully to detect the size of the defect,
                    its place, and its progress. Using machine learning to detect these faults is very helpful since
                    mostly the faulty bearing's signals might follow the same non-linear function that needs to be detected
                    and distinguished. In my thesis, this has been done, and with an accuracy of 95% using the
                    random forest and other methods via Matlab, it is possible to predict bearing faults with much more confidence.
