      My research mainly focuses on Path Planning through Reinforcement Learning (RL) under the supervision of S A A Moosavian on K.N.Toosi University.<br>
      More specifically, I study the following topics:<br>
      <ol style="font-weight: bold;">
        <li>Deep Reinforcement Learning</li>
        <li>Off-policy policy evaluation and optimization</li>
        <li>Application of RLon path planning</li>
      </ol>

        Volunteer Role: Section Leader, Code in Place<br>
         Member of the teaching team for Code In Place, April - May 2021. 
         This online course was offered by Stanford University during the COVID-19 pandemic.
         It brought together 12,000 students and 1100 volunteer teachers participating from around the world.
         The course is a 6-week introduction to Python programming using materials from the first half of Stanfordâ€™s CS106A course.
         As a volunteer section leader, 
         I prepared and taught a weekly discussion section of 8-10 students to supplement professors' lectures.
