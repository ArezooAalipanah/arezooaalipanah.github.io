      <cite class="more--cite">Bibliophile:</cite>
      <p class="more--p">I have always been obsessed with books since my childhood.
        I even prefer books to movies because they allow me to have my imagination to build characters and their attitudes.
        Some of my favorite books are listed here:<br><br><br>
        The Night Circus,<br><br>
        This book is full of magic. With almost every page, I felt myself inside a new magical world. Besides that,
        the narrator( Jim Dale) was so great, which made the book even more magical.<br><br><br>
        The Queen's Gambit,<br><br>
        This book was great and enthusiastic for me. The story is about a girl, Beth Harmon, who is a grandmaster in chess.
        In her time, there were almost no girls playing chess. The way she handled competing against all other grandmasters
        and not listening to other people on the fact that girls are not capable of playing chess was inspiring for me,
        especially since in my major, mechanical engineering, and my passions like mountain climbing and coding,
        people always said to me that they are not suitable for a girl and wanted me to quit. However,
        I tried my best my way and did not get demotivated by their statements. This is why I found my character near to Beth Harmon's.<br><br><br>
        Deep Work,<br><br>
        Talking about how to exceed in our career and especially our academic experiences,
        this book is about deep work. Not to get bothered by social media and concentrate better to be more efficient.
        I never had a Twitter account,
        and after starting this book, I even decided to deactivate my Instagram account,
        especially since there was news coming from everywhere and I needed to concentrate.<br><br>
        Also, you can read my reviews on good reads, and I am on the top 100 best reviewers list in Iran.</p>

      <cite class="more--cite">On top of the mountains:</cite>
      <p class="more--p">I have climbed most of the tallest mountains in Iran, and I have been mountain
        climbing professionally for about four years. (unfortunately, because of the pandemic last year, I couldn't
        climb many mountains, though.) My favorite mountains were sofar Damavand(tallest mountain in Iran),
        Sabalan(a gorgeous one with a great lake on the peak), and Hezar.<br><br>
        I usually climb mountains with a group, and this group work had significant benefits in my life.<br><br>
        First of all, I understood that sometimes we should sacrifice our own needs for the sake of the group.
        People might have different paces and strengths, and for a group to become successful weaker people should try more
        not to slow down the group, and the stronger ones should not go far from others and try to help the more vulnerable
        members as best as they could.<br><br>
        Second, It is essential to have a leader and follow their guide even if you feel they are not a
        hundred percent right. In my experiences, even if we go the wrong way, but as a whole group and following
        the leader, we will end up in a better situation than each member does their leading.<br><br>
        There are so many other benefits too, and these were only two of them.<br><br>
        I also encourage you to check the pictures of my adventures on the gallery page.

      <cite class="more--cite">Linguaphile:</cite>
      <p class="more--p">I was bilingual from the beginning days of my life since I was born in Ardebil,
        a city in Iran with the Azerbaijani language, and our national language was Persian.
        I found learning new languages very engaging and exciting. I loved the English language
        and tried to improve my skills since I was five years old. After reaching a good proficiency in this language,
        I started learning French too. I want to learn French and more languages because knowing a new language is
        like entering a whole new world. I never read translated books in English because it is like having a barrel
        between the writer and me. I hope I can learn more languages.</p>
