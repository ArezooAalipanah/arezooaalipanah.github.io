            A Novel Intelligent Parallel Parking System Based on Fuzzy Logic Without Using Sensor
        </cite>
    </h1><br>
    <p class="abs">
        The applications of intelligent systems have received a growing interest in the automobile industry.
        The car parking issue is one of the challenges for drivers, which can be solved by these smart systems.
        In this study, a new method for automatic parallel parking problems is proposed.
        The suggested method uses fuzzy inference to control, steer, and park the car in a tight space.
        Two parallel embedded fuzzy controllers have been designed to navigate the vehicle on the desired path.
        Unlike other studies that have used the error between developed and reference routes,
        the proposed method only uses the car’s position data, similar to an experienced driver.
        There is no need to use the sensors to track the desired path in this method, but the car’s kinematic model’s
        output is the controllers' input.
        Based on the obtained results, the generated path by controllers is close to the desired track.<br><br><br>

            Easy-GT: Open-Source Software to Facilitate Making the Ground Truth for White Blood Cells Nucleus
        </cite>
    </h1><br>
    <p class="abs">
        The nucleus of white blood cells (WBCs) plays a significant role in their detection and classification.
        Appropriate feature extraction of the nucleus is necessary to fit a suitable artificial intelligence model to classify WBCs.
        Therefore, designing a method is needed to segment the nucleus accurately.
        The detected nuclei should be compared with the ground truths identified by a hematologist to obtain
        a proper performance evaluation of the nucleus segmentation method. It is a time-consuming and tedious
        task for experts to establish the ground truth manually. This paper presents an intelligent open-source
        software called Easy-GT to create the ground truth of WBCs nucleus faster and easier. This software first
        detects the nucleus by employing a new otsu's thresholding based method with a dice similarity coefficient
        (DSC) of 95.42 %; the hematologist can then create a more accurate ground truth,
        using the designed buttons to modify the threshold value. This software can speed
        up ground truths forming process more than six times.<br><br><br>
